📌 Project Overview

SVF-CONSTRUCTION is a responsive website built for a construction and real-estate business. The goal of this project is to showcase services, highlight project portfolios, and provide a simple way for customers to estimate home construction costs and contact the company.

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in full-stack web development, where I applied front-end development skills and structured the code for future backend integration.
